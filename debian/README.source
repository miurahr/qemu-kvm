This package uses the quilt patch system as documented in the Debian quilt
package (/usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source).

To update this package to a new upstream version, some binary files must be
removed from the upstream tarball.
The get-orig-source target in debian/rules will download and clean the tarball
for the current version (according to debian/changelog). To get a newer
version, first update the changelog and then run get-orig-source.
