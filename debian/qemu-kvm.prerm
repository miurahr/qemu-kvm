# prerm script for qemu-kvm
#
# This script is needed to support downgrades to versions <0.13.
# In 0.13, /usr/share/kvm/keymaps changed from a directory with
# files to a symlink to /usr/share/qemu/keymaps, a separately
# packaged keymaps.
#
# When we downgrade from 0.13 to 0.12 or lower version, dpkg
# does not remove the symlink before unpacking so that files
# from 0.12- version overwrites the ones in qemu-keymaps
# package.
#
# We fix this by removing symlink before unpack if we downgrading
# to a version <0.13.
#
# In order to be able to unwind this rm in case something goes
# wrong, `postinst abort-upgrade' will be called to restore the
# symlink back.
